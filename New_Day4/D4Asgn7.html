        <h2>Day 4 Assignment No. 7</h2>
        <h3>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
            except 1 and itself.<br>
            In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.<br>
            For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.<br><br>
            Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.<br>
            For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.<br>
            P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value<br>
