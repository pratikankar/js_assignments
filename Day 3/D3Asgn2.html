        <h2>Day 3 Assignment No. 2</h2>
        <h3>Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.</h3>
        <h5>Code is included in the html file itself in script tags</h5>
        <p>
            <b>var:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined.<br>
            If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global. var is “function scoped”.
            Example:<br>
            {                                       <br>
                var a=10;                           <br>
                console.log(a);                     <br>
            }                       //block 1       <br>
            {                                       <br>
                a++;                                <br>
                console.log(a);                     <br>
            }                      //block 2        <br><br><br>

            <b>let:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces<br>
            i.e. {} . “let” and “const” are“block scoped”.<br>
            Example:<br>
            {                                       <br>
                let a=10;                           <br>
                console.log(a);                     <br>
            }                       //block 1       <br>
            {                                       <br>
                a++;                                <br>
                console.log(a);                     <br>
            }                       //block 2       <br><br><br>
            <b>const:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces.<br>
            However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned. “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.<br>
            Example:<br>
            var PI;                                 <br>
            {                                       <br>
                const PI=3.14;                      <br>
                console.log(PI);                    <br>
            }                       //block 1       <br>
            {                                       <br>
                console.log(PI);                    <br>
            }                       //block 2       <br><br>
        </p>
        <script>
            {
                var a=10;
                console.log(a);
            }                       //block 1
            {
                a++;
                console.log(a);
            }                      //block 2
            /* Since we are using "var a=10", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. 
            In this case it is within the global function scope */
        </script>

        <script>
            {
                let a=10;
                console.log(a);
            }                       //block 1
            {
                a++;
                console.log(a);
            }                       //block 2
            /* Since we are using "let a=10", scope of "a" is limited to block 1 and "a" is not recognized in block 2 */
        </script>

        <script>
            var PI;
            {
                const PI=3.14;
                console.log(PI);
            }                       //block 1
            {
                console.log(PI);
            }                       //block 2
            /* Since we are using "const PI=3.14", scope of "PI" is limited to block 1 and "PI" is not recognized in block 2, so undefined*/
