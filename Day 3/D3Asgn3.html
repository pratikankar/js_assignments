        <h2>Day 3 Assignment No. 3</h2>
        <h3>Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.</h3>
        <h5>Code is included in the html file itself in script tags</h5>
        <p>
        <b>1.Boolean :</b> A boolean represents only one of two values: true, or false. Think of a boolean as an on/off or a yes/no switch.<br>
        var boo1 = true;<br>
        var boo2 = false;<br><br><br>

        <b>2. Number :</b> There is only one type of Number in JavaScript. Numbers can be written with or without a decimal point. A number can also be +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not a number).<br>
        var num1 = 32;<br>
        var num2 = +Infinity;<br><br><br>

        <b>3. String :</b> Strings are used for storing text. Strings must be inside of either double or single quotes. In JS, Strings are immutable.<br>
        var str1 = 'hello, it is me';<br>
        var str2 = "hello, it's me";<br><br><br>

        <b>4. Null :</b> Null has one value: null. It is explicitly nothing.<br>
        var nothing = null;<br><br><br>

        <b>5. Undefined :</b> A variable that has no value is undefined.<br>
        var testVar;<br>
        console.log(testVar);      // will give undefined in log <br><br><br>

        <b>6. Symbol :</b> Symbols are new in ES6. A Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. For the sake of brevity, that is the extent that this article will cover Symbols.<br>
        const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');<br>
        </p>

            var boo1 = true;
            var boo2 = false;
            var num1 = 32;
            var num2 = +Infinity;
            var str1 = 'hello, it is me';
            var str2 = "hello, it's me";
            var nothing = null;
            var testVar;
            console.log(testVar);
            const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');
